Mini Project 2: Advanced NLP – Text Classification
📌 Project Overview
This project extends the concepts of NLP by focusing on text classification using advanced preprocessing and machine learning methods. The task is to analyze textual data (e.g., product reviews, social media posts, or survey responses) and classify them into categories such as positive/negative sentiment or topic labels.

🚀 Features
Data preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization
Advanced vectorization techniques: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, embeddings
Machine Learning models for classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)
Model performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Visualization of data distribution and model results
📂 Dataset
Source: Text dataset (e.g., reviews, tweets, or survey data)
Format: Labeled text samples for supervised learning
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, scikit-learn, gensim, wordcloud
